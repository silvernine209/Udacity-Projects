# Udacity - Machine Learning Nanodegree Portfolio
This repo contains various in-depth machine learning projects completed in process of earning [Machine Learning Nanodegree Certificate](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/SASJTP7Y).

## Repository Intro
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my portfolio containing various machine learning projects.

### Projects
* [Deep Learning](https://github.com/silvernine209/Udacity-Projects/tree/master/Deep%20Learning) : Contains projects that used deep learning (CNN&MLP) to perform fairly simple image classifications and prediction.
* [Identify Dog Breed](https://github.com/silvernine209/Udacity-Projects/tree/master/IDentify%20Dog%20Breed) : Contains an app built on CNN model developed by transfer learning.
* [Identify Potential Donors](https://github.com/silvernine209/Udacity-Projects/tree/master/Identify%20Potential%20Donors) : Utilizes supervised learning to predict potential donors for charity.
* [Predict Housing Price](https://github.com/silvernine209/Udacity-Projects/tree/master/Predict%20Housing%20Price) : Develops a model using supervised learning to predict housing prices in Boston.
* [Segment Customers](https://github.com/silvernine209/Udacity-Projects/tree/master/Segment%20Customers) : Uses unsupervised learning to develop a model that segments customers into different groups in order to make business decisions.
* [Teach Quadcopter to Takeoff](https://github.com/silvernine209/Udacity-Projects/tree/master/Teach%20Quadcopter%20to%20Takeoff) : This is an reinforced learning application that uses deep deterministic policy gradients with actor-critic, ornstein-uhlenbeck noise, and replay buffer to teach a quadcoptoer how to reach a target location from ground position, idle, with no moving parts initially.
